When i will finish a beta version of this, everybody can use it for create a new web, just send my request with the domain you want, and your IP.


2. Installation for users of the domains

For installing the domains and website on your Linux/Unix computer, you must download files given by the webmaster. If is the first time you use this program, you must execute save.sh by going with terminal in the folder of files and type "./save.sh" and enter your password. It will make a save of your original domain file (called hosts file by unix). Now you can use update.sh for installing domains by simply typing "./update.sh" and enter your password. If there is a problem with your Internet access or you want to uninstall it, you must restore the save of your domains file by typing "./restore.sh" in the folder of files of MyDomain
